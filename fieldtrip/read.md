## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

My project would be about combining different art pieces to make fusion pieces. For example, there is a painting of a bison, as well as a huge 3 part painting of the grand canyon. I would combine the 2. The bison could be visiting the grand canyon, maybe make it funny like the bison is a tourist with a camera or something idk.

### Core Webpages

The index page would have some basic info about what I'm all about, combining popular artworks. There would be all the ones I combined, and when you click on them it brings you to their page, showing off the art they are based on. The individual pages would also have why I was inspired to mix and match the art. Etc etc.

### Design Choices

I would want to make my website look like a normal museum website, until you realize it is silly, where the artworks are not quite normal (because they are fused fr). It could be similar to the museum that we went to website, since that is where to peices come from.

I have some photos but I'm on a time crunch have a good day
